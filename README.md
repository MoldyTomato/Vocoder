## Disclaimer

This project is more a proof of concept than anything else.  
See https://github.com/MoldyTomato/Vocoder/blob/main/Documentation/Documentation.pdf for usage.  
It can break if pushed and could potentially cause damage and harm. Use at your own risk!
Regarding the code: Readability, speed and size could be improved. But: finish fast :) may revisit this later
